Born in 1996, I grew up in the midst of the digital rise. As a teenager I started building my first websites and got more and more interested in the digital economy.

I am a passionate, energetic, and self-motivated full-stack software developer eager to turn ideas into applications. My ambitions are to stay on the leading edge of the web development industry.

I always look to find new learning opportunities or projects to rapidly keep improving as a developer.
