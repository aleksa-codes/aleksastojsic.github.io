Born in 1996, I grew up during the digital rise. As a teenager, I started building my first websites and got more and more interested in the digital economy.

After school, I started to study <Underlining highlight>Computer Science as a bachelor's degree</Underlining> at Singidunum University and completed many online courses alongside.

I am a passionate, energetic, and self-motivated junior <Underlining highlight>full-stack software developer</Underlining> eager to turn ideas into applications. My ambitions are to stay on the leading edge of the <Underlining highlight>web development</Underlining> industry and find new learning opportunities or projects to keep improving rapidly as a developer.

Out of the office, you will find me dreaming of basketball, playing video games, and petting all the good cats.
